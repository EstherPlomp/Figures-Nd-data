# Figures-Nd-data
Data and code underlying the figures of the article 'Neodymium isotopes in modern human dental enamel: an exploratory dataset for human provenancing'


# Installation
These scripts were generated in R and RStudio (Version 1.4.1717). Required packages: tidyverse.

Installation of the package and loading the data should only take several minutes. 

# How to use
You should copy both the .Rmd file and the data files to an R project if you want to reproduce the figures. Otherwise, browse the Rmd file and see what is of reuse to you :)
